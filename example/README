In this directory, you will find examples to learn programming in Lisaac Ω.
There are essentially two indispensable tools: 'elix' and 'lisaac'.
'elix' is the code editor / viewer
'lisaac' is the compiler for the Lisaac Ω language

Let us take for example the hello_world.li program.
To view the code in this directory, simply open a terminal, move to this directory, and run the command "elix hello_world.li".

To compile and run this program, again using a terminal, move to this directory and type the command "lisaac hello_world.li". This will produce an executable machine code file that you can run by typing "./hello_world" (or "hello_world.exe" if you are on Windows).

Note that the lisaac compiler generates C as a portable intermediate language.
It is then your C compiler, often gcc or clang, that translates it into directly executable machine code.

To get started with Lisaac Ω, we suggest trying the different examples provided in this lisaac/example directory.

Note: A very useful option of the lisaac command is the -boost option.
This option must be added at the end of the command line and allows you to get an executable with top performance. Very small and very fast.
Of course, during the development phase, to inspect the stack in case of a problem, it is better to avoid the -boost option.
To know all the options of the lisaac command, use the -help option ("lisaac -help").
