In this directory, you will find the code for the elix command,
which is the IDE for the Lisaac Î© language.
To recompile with assertions enabled:

   lisaac elix

Note that elix is a very large piece of software, and compiling it with all
assertions enabled can take a long time, and the resulting executable may
be quite large.
As always, to compile without assertions and without crash information:

   lisaac elix -boost

It is possible to provide a path to a source file when launching elix,
for example:

   elix ~/lisaac/example/welcome/welcome.li
   
When closing elix, all your preferences are automatically saved in ~/.elix.cfg.
