The program auto_test.li automatically runs all the tests and recompiles all the examples
from the distribution.
To compile and run all the tests in this directory, you can, for example, use:

   lisaac auto_test
   ./auto_test .


If you find a bug in lisaac/lib, please send us a test program that reproduces the bug you encountered,
