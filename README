Welcome to the Lisaac Î© world !

Once properly installed, you will have access to the code editor 'elix' as well as
the command-line compiler 'lisaac'.
With these two commands, you can do almost everything.

The simplest way to get started is to launch elix from a terminal and explore the example code,
which will be accessible through the tabs and is mostly located in the lisaac/example directory.
For instance, you can start with lisaac/example/hello_world.li.

The full source code of the lisaac compiler as well as that of elix is included in this distribution.

The remainder of this file provides installation instructions for Lisaac Omega.
